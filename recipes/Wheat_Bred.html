        <ul>500 g wheat flour</ul>
        <ul>350 ml water, lukewarm</ul>
        <ul>1 tbsp. olive oil</ul>
        <ul>2 tsp. salt</ul>

        <ul>1 Â½ cup/s milk</ul>
        <ul>1 bag/s of dry yeast</ul>
    

    
        <ol>Put the flour and all the other ingredients in a bowl and mix with a wooden spoon until the dough no longer sticks to the bowl.</ol>
        <ol>Cover the bowl with a cloth and let the dough rise for 30 minutes. Line a 500 g loaf pan with baking paper.</ol>
        <ol>After 30 minutes, flour the work surface, the dough and your hands. Lift the dough from the bowl and knead again by hand for tension. </ol>
        <ol>Put the dough in the mold and smooth it with a pastry brush with a little water. </ol>
        <ol>Make a lengthwise cut and place in a cold oven. The baking time starts when the baking temperature is reached, about 40 min. at 170 degrees top/bottom heat.</ol>
